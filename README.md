# Draft Chrome Extension

I've open sourced Draft's Chrome extension, hoping the Draft community can make it a lot better. I've gotten a lot of requests for this functionality in a Firefox and Safari extension. Hopefully this can seed those projects.

Bookmarklets and browser extensions like Instapaper, Evernote's Clearly, and Readability make reading anything on the web simple, focused, and gorgeous. Why can't writing be that way?

[Draft](http://draftin.com) is an application that let's you have a distraction free writing environment on the web, easy version control, and simple collaboration. I want to write everything in Draft.

So [here's a Chrome extension that lets you](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/draft/amlbbbgcijmiooecobhkjblcdkjldmdk).

Any webpage that you can write on, you can now use Draft with. Your blog, Gmail, Twitter, Facebook, even comment boxes on websites like Reddit and Hacker News.

Just place your cursor in the box you want to write in, click the Chrome Draft extension, and Draft will open up in a new Chrome Tab. 

Choose an already written document or something new to write in Draft. When you're done, there's a menu button to paste your work back into the text box you came from. 

All of a sudden, everything you write everywhere is focused, versioned, and able to be shared with friends for help before you publish. I hope you like it. This might be the neatest and handiest things I've ever made. :)
